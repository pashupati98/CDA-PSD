# Crack Density Analysis using Image Processing
A MATLAB program was developed using Image Processing which can quantify the crackgenerated on a surface using an image taken via an optical microscope.  This program takesa RGB image as input and output the crack density on that image

# Particle Size Determination Using MATLAB
A program which can calculate the diameter of particles of nano order via an image taken bymicrosope.  This program take the images of the nano particles as input and calculates thediameter and further it takes the average over various data points and finally outputs the average.
